The official repo for "DA-STC: Domain Adaptive Video Semantic Segmentation via Spatio-Temporal Consistency"

Abstract: Video semantic segmentation is a pivotal aspect of video representation learning.  However, significant domain shifts often lead to performance degradation of supervised source models when applied to unseen target videos without annotation. In this work, we propose ......
